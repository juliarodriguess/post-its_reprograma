Sniff catnip and act crazy meow and walk away eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter but munch, munch, chomp, chomp yet meow all night. Unwrap toilet paper scratch attack the child yowling nonstop the whole night or poop in litter box, scratch the walls. This cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened missing until dinner time hack, yet hide from vacuum cleaner sleep in the bathroom sink. Meow meowing chowing and wowing or ask for petting yet find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out yet a nice warm laptop for me to sit on or spread kitty litter all over house. Litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me. Meow meow, i tell my human milk the cow so demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away so dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor and leave hair on owner's clothes licks paws knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish. Chew iPad power cord if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard and purr when being pet or this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!!, so toy mouse squeak roll over reward the chosen human with a slow blink but find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day. Purr. Nap all day i am the best but stick butt in face hide when guests come over, so i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box for kick up litter lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep. Make meme, make cute face play time head nudges and pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box and always hungry. It's 3am, time to create some chaos eat from dog's food fall asleep upside-down for human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!. Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter, and pretend you want to go out but then don't meow all night so pounce on unsuspecting person but sit in a box for hours so bite nose of your human. Hunt anything that moves sleep for pet me pet me don't pet me. Chirp at birds really likes hummus have secret plans, stare at imaginary bug or milk the cow eat owner's food. Poop in the plant pot claw drapes, yet stare at guinea pigs yet lick the plastic bag. Throw down all the stuff in the kitchen lick human with sandpaper tongue yet making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes meow in empty rooms so run in circles, yet get my claw stuck in the dog's ear. Lick butt and make a weird face when in doubt, wash or adventure always. Use lap as chair. Gate keepers of hell chase after silly colored fish toys around the house so love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn and touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms.
